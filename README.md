# UnivrsityProject
This is my Java Web App project from univrsity.
At the time of making this project I was not familiar with Spring Framweork.
That's the reason for lots of code duplication and tons of classes, but at least it works. I'm sure it can be optimized additionaly, but at the moment I'm enroled for Java Web Developer course at SoftUni and I don't have that much time to invest.
Once I'm done with the course I'm planning to remake this project, but this time using Spring Framework.


The whole project is in JavaWebApp1.zip file.

The export of the DB is in the Dump20200424.zip file.



To do:

1. Remake whole project using Spring.

2. Make it work with Docker.
